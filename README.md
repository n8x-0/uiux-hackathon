Note: super confused because two figma files were circulating, I got one with 18 pages while others with around 5 - 6 pages. I didn't get sir Ameen reply so I left other extra pages realizing I had completed those 5-6 pages in jsut 10 hours.

pages included:

/ (home {click the nike logo})<br/> 
/signin<br/>
/joinus<br/>
/contact (help {in the top most header})<br/>
/bag (favorite and cart page {click header icons at the right corner})<br/>
/bag/checkout (go to the cart or fav and click memeber checkout button)<br/>
/products (nav {new & featured}) || (other buttons are for category filter, functionality isnt implemented)<br/>
/ prod details dynamic route (click any product any where) <br/>
/ prod by category dynamic
<br/>
Extra pages:<br/>

/ dynamic page with another layout (click SNKRES from navbar)<br/>
/internship (link is in the footer)<br/>
/membership (link is in the footer)<br/>
